Yuuki — Modular Discord Bot Ecosystem

Yuuki is a modular, extensible bot ecosystem designed for performance, customization, and developer freedom.
Built on a fast Go-based core, Yuuki allows anyone to extend its functionality through plug-and-play modules, including optional QuickJS-powered scripting for dynamic features.

Yuuki comes in two modes—User Mode and Server Mode—but shares the same plugin ecosystem, ensuring full compatibility across both environments.

Key Features

High-performance Go core optimized for reliability and low latency.

Modular architecture: add, remove, and configure plugins at runtime.

Unified plugin ecosystem compatible with both user and server instances.

Optional QuickJS module for JavaScript-based custom logic.

Open-source by design: modify, inspect, or expand freely.

Extensible command system: each plugin provides its own help, settings, and functionality.


Vision

Yuuki aims to become an open platform where developers and users collaborate to build flexible, powerful Discord automation—without locking anyone into a single workflow or coding style.
